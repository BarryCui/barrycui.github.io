# TryHackMe: Wireshark 101 Room Writeup

> Learn the basics of Wireshark and how to analyze various protocols and PCAPs

### Task 7

**What is the Opcode for Packet 6?**

![](/img/posts/arp_1.png)

> request(1)

**What is the source MAC Address of Packet 19?**

![](/img/posts/arp_2.png)

> 80:fb:06:f0:45:d7

**What 4 packets are Reply packets?**

use this display filter:

```
arp.opcode == 2
```

and the result is here:

![](/img/posts/arp_3.png)

> 76,400,459,520

**What IP Address is at 80:fb:06:f0:45:d7?**

Below you can see the MAC address is paired with IP 10.251.23.1:

![](/img/posts/arp_4.png)

> 10.251.23.1

### Task 8

**What is the type for packet 4?**

![](/img/posts/icmp_1.png)

> 8

**What is the type for packet 5?**

![](/img/posts/icmp_2.png)

> 0



**What is the timestamp for packet 12, only including month day and year?**

**note: Wireshark bases it’s time off of your devices time zone, if your answer is wrong try one day more or less.**

![](/img/posts/icmp_3.png)
In the above picture you can see that the timestamp is May 31, 2013, but it's based on my timezone, which is in China. So the answer may be shifted one day back or forth.
> May 30, 2013

**What is the full data string for packet 18?**

Unfold the data panel and copy the value:
![](/img/posts/icmp_4.png)
> 08090a0b0c0d0e0f101112131415161718191a1b1c1d1e1f202122232425262728292a2b2c2d2e2f3031323334353637

### Task 10

**What is being queried in packet 1?**

Copy and paste the query value:
![](/img/posts/dns_1.png)
> 8.8.8.8.in-addr.arpa

**What site is being queried in packet 26?**

![](/img/posts/dns_2.png)
> www.wireshark.org

**What is the Transaction ID for packet 26?**

Transaction ID is the identifier chosen by the client when it's sending a question to the server.
The server then will responds along with that ID.
![](/img/posts/dns_3.png)
> 0x2c58

### Task 11

**What percent of packets originate from Domain Name System?**

Go to Statistics - Protocol Hierarchy:
![](/img/posts/http_1.png)
> 4.7

**What endpoint ends in .237?**

Go to Statistics - Endpoints:
![](/img/posts/http_2.png)
> 145.254.160.237

**What is the user-agent listed in packet 4?**

![](/img/posts/http_3.png)
